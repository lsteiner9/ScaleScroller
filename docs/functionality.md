## Key functional elements

* For each level, the app displays a scale name and its notes for several seconds. Then the sidescroller starts, and the user can control their character to move up and down. The objective is to collect (run over) the coins labeled with correct notes, and avoid coins labeled with incorrect notes. Correct notes add points, while incorrect notes take away one of three total lives. To beat the level, the user must get a certain amount of points/go for a certain amount of time without losing all three lives.

* Learn mode is the easier mode. This mode starts with C Major and progresses around the circle of fifths with each level, gradually increasing difficulty (C Major, G Major, F Major, D Major, Bb Major, and so on). In learn mode, the user must beat the level in order to progress to more difficult scales. If the player does not beat the level, they can repeat the current level or try previous levels that have already been unlocked. This allows for practicing and learning each scale. 

* Challenge mode is harder: the user is expected to already know their scales, either from progressing through learn mode or through external instruction. Challenge mode can start with any scale, and once each level is beaten, a new random scale appears. The speed of the sidescroller progressively gets faster as the user beats more scale levels. Once the game has ended, the score is recorded and added to a high score board, if applicable.
