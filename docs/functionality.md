## Detailed Functionality

* For each level, the app displays a scale name and its notes for several seconds.

* The sidescroller starts, and the user can control their character to move up and down.

	* The objective is to collect (run over) the coins labeled with correct notes, and avoid coins labeled with incorrect notes.

	* Correct notes add points, while incorrect notes take away lives. There are three lives total.

	* To beat the level, the user must get a certain amount of points/go for a certain amount of time without losing all three lives.

* Once the level has been beaten, the user is asked whether to play again or to go to the next level, with a new scale. 

* Learn mode is the easiest mode. This mode starts with C Major and progresses around the circle of fifths with each level, gradually increasing difficulty. In learn mode, the user must beat the level in order to progress; otherwise, the current level must be repeated. This allows for practicing and learning each scale. 

* Challenge mode is more difficult, and works best when the user has already progressed through learn mode to learn most or all of their scales. In challenge mode, any scale can appear at any point. The speed of the sidescroller progressively gets faster as the user beats more scale levels. Once the game has ended, the score is added to a high score board, if applicable.
