## Build instructions

1. From the [ScaleScroller GitHub repository](https://github.com/lsteiner9/scale-scroller), click on the green Code button, make sure SSH is selected, and click the clipboard icon.

2. In Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA, create a new project from version control. Make sure the version control is set to Git, and paste the link copied in step 1 into the URL field. After selecting your desired project location, click on clone.

3. After the project has fully loaded, run the application on the device of your choice. You may need to select the device and the application from a pulldown if they do not initially show up.
