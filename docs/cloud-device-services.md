## Cloud- or device-based services or data

* Device audio, accessed through MediaPlayer 

	* Click for [an overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer) or [documentation.](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer)

	* Audio played through MediaPlayer enhances the game with music and sound effects. For example, when an incorrect coin is picked up, a sound effect is part of the indication of the mistake. A different sound effect indicates a correct answer. A soundtrack for the game is a stretch goal, but if implemented, will also be played through MediaPlayer.

	* Audio is not critical to the functionality of the app, and can be turned off if desired. For example, there will be visual indications of correct/incorrect coins as well as sound, so those sound effects are not critical. 

* Google Sign-in 
	
	* Click for [documentation.](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating)

	* Sign-in will let the user associate their data with a username and account. This will allow multiple players to use the app on the same device. 
	
	* Sign-in is not required. If Sign-in is unavailable or the user wishes to play as a guest, the app will still work. User data will still be recorded, with one player per device.
