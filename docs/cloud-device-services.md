## Cloud- or device-based services or data

* Device audio, accessed through MediaPlayer 

	* Click for [an overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer) or [documentation.](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer)

	* Audio played through MediaPlayer enhances the game with music and sound effects. For example, when an incorrect coin is picked up, a sound effect is part of the indication of the mistake. A different sound effect indicates a correct answer.

	* Audio is not critical to the functionality of the app, and can be turned off if desired. 

* Google Sign-in 
	
	* Click for [documentation.](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating)

	* Sign-in lets the user associate their data with a username and account. This allows multiple players to use the app on the same device. 
	
	* Currently, Sign In is required, as there is currently no way to continue as a guest. Ideally, Sign In would not be required: if Sign In is unavailable or the user wishes to play as a guest, the app will still work. User data will still be recorded, with one player per device.
