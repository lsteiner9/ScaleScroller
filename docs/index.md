## Project Description

ScaleScroller is a game that allows the user to learn or practice their knowledge of musical scales. The user controls their character by moving up and down to collect coins. Each level uses a different musical scale, and coins are labeled with either correct musical note names found in that scale or with incorrect note names. Collecting correct coins adds points, but collecting an incorrect coin takes away one of three in-game lives. Learn mode allows the user to start with the easiest scales and gradually teaches them all common Western classical scales. Challenge mode allows the user to test their knowledge: any scale can appear at any point, and the sidescroller gets progressively faster and faster with each completed scale level.

My motivation for creating this app was to bring together my enjoyment of video games and my passion for teaching music. As a music theory teacher for undergraduate music majors, I found that knowledge of scales was simultaneously one of the hardest and one of the most important things for students to master. Unfortunately, the best way to master scales is a lot of practice and drilling, which students usually get bored with or don't have time for. This particular app was born out of ideas from a chapter in *Studies in Historical Improvisation*, edited by Massimiliano Guido. In the chapter, "Teaching Theory through Improvisation," theorist Peter Schubert discusses how to make theory classrooms provide the same sort of feedback as a mobile phone game. This immediate, painless feedback allows players of games to quickly learn how to succeed at games, and this type of feedback in the classroom can help students to learn more quickly and happily. My app is an extension of that idea - if we can bring aspects of games into the theory classroom, then why not bring aspects of the theory classroom into a game? The app focuses on scales, which here only require knowledge of the alphabet to understand. This means that even non-musicians can start playing with the app, but with progress through the levels, they can learn the most foundational aspects of Western classical music. For players who already have knowledge of scales, they can continue learning or test their knowledge with random scales. This allows the app to have wide appeal to people interested in improving their musical knowledge.
