## Current implementation state

Currently, the layout and navigation between screens is set up, and the app looks generally like it is intended to. The gameplay is not yet working.

Functional issues:

* TBD

Aesthetic/cosmetic issues:

* Change font style to match the music note icon better.

* Get scale notes to display in order.

Functional stretch goals:

* Allow the user to unlock new playable characters (whole note, quarter note, dotted notes, rests, etc.) as they progress through the game.

* Allow the user to input their own custom collections (octatonic, wholetone, jazz modal scales, etc.).

* Chord mode: collections of correct notes are smaller (three or four possibilities each), “levels” are much shorter, and transitions between levels are very fast. This trains the user to quickly switch between chords.
  
* Listen mode: allow the user to control the character not by up/down on the screen, but by accessing the microphone. The user can use their instrument or voice to play the notes required to collect the correct coins.

    * Include transposition settings for clarinet, etc.
  
* Allow user-submitted “songs” (series of notes) to “play”
  
* Rhythm mode: instead of a pitch collection, the user is shown a time signature. They must collect coins that fill up a measure's worth of rhythmic values, then collect a barline coin, then repeat.
