## User Story:

As a Theory 1 student at UND, my professor expects me to be able to write out scales very quickly, with complete accuracy. The challenge mode of this app lets me practice multiple different scales and gives me immediate feedback on the wrong notes - and my grade has already started going up!

## Use Case:

**Title:** Scale practice

**Description:** Trying to get a good enough score to get on the personal top 10 leaderboard again.

**Name of user & their role:** David, a music ed major at UND who has struggled with scales.

**Usage Preconditions:** David has the app installed on his phone, and has already logged in. He has played challenge mode before, and has already filled up the leaderboard with high scores.

**Usage post conditions:** David feels more confident, and has gotten some more practice on scales that were intimidating before.

**Interaction Flow:**

   * David opens the app, and selects challenge mode.
   
   * He stops challenge mode and goes to the main screen to look back at the leaderboard. He notes the score to beat before entering challenge mode again.
   
   * The name and notes of the first scale, E melodic minor, appear on-screen for a few seconds.
   
   * David easily goes through the level and the next few without losing any lives.
   
   * The fifth level is A Major, which David always confuses with D Major. He collects a G natural coin, and loses a life. This helps him remember to pick G# the next time, and he doesn't make that mistake again in this level.
   
   * David goes through a few more levels, and eventually loses all three lives by the middle of level 11.
   
   * David is shown his score, which gets him into position seven on his high-score list.
   
   * David closes the app.
   
**Frequency of Use:** Twice a week
