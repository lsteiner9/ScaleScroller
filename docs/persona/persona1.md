## User Persona

![Frank](../img/persona1.jpg)

* Name: Frank Bower

* Age: 34

* Occupation: Director of media and outreach at Smiles4Kids, a regional non-profit  

* Technology: Phone: Motorola Moto G7

* Personality: Optimistic and outgoing, always up for a new challenge or for ways to improve. 

* Needs/Goals/Features: 

    * Wants to learn to play the cello, as a new hobby
    
    * Also wants to learn how music works, so he can share it with some of the kids he mentors (and to keep up with his 9-year-old daughter, who is learning piano).
    
* Frustrations:

    * Other apps for teaching scales are boring, and some only make sense if you play a single instrument. 
    
    * Learning the cello is already going to take time away from his family and his other hobby of casual gaming, so the thought of spending time on a boring app is not appealing. 
     
## User Story:

I'm an adult who has never studied written music before, but I would like to learn. The learn mode of this app gradually teaches me scales in the form of a fun game, so I don't get bored with rote memorization.

## Use Case:

**Title:** The C Major scale

**Description:** Learning the notes that make up the C Major scale and practicing that knowledge

**Name of user & their role:** Frank, a director at a non-profit who wants to learn written music. 

**Usage Preconditions:** Frank has the app installed on his phone, and has either logged in previously with GoogleSignIn or has internet access to do so now. 

**Usage post conditions:** Frank feels confident that he knows the notes in the C major scale, and tries to figure out the scale on his cello.

**Interaction Flow:**

   * Frank opens the app.
   
   * Frank clicks on Learn Mode and is taken to a screen with all of the possible scales.
   
   * Because Frank has not beaten any levels, all are grayed out except for C Major. Frank picks the C Major scale.
   
   * The title and notes of the scale are shown on screen for a few seconds, and then the scroller begins.
   
   * Frank controls his character to move up and down, collecting the coins that correspond to notes of the C Major scale he was just shown.
   
   * Frank accidentally collects a Gb coin, and loses one life.
   
   * Frank makes it through the rest of the level without losing another life, and is congratulated.
   
   * The app returns back to the scale-select screen, and the button for G Major is now available. 
   
   * Frank closes the app for now. Time to practice.
   
**Frequency of Use:** Every other day, if time
