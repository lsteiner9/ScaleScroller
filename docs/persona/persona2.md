## User Story:

As a 9-year-old taking piano lessons, my teacher quizzes me about key signatures and scales, but I always get them wrong and we spend a long time talking about them in each lesson. It's boringgggg. This app helps teach me my scales in learn mode, so we can spend more of my lesson time playing piano!

## Use Case:

**Title:** The Ab Major scale

**Description:** Learning the notes that make up the Ab Major scale and practicing that knowledge

**Name of user & their role:** Camilla, a young student who wants to get better at her scales 

**Usage Preconditions:** Camilla has the app installed on her phone, and her parents have logged her in previously with GoogleSignIn. 

**Usage post conditions:** Camilla passed the level without losing any lives, and flaunts it over her father (who lost a life to pass an easier level).

**Interaction Flow:**

   * Camilla opens the app.
   
   * Camilla clicks on Learn Mode and is taken to a screen with all of the possible scales.
   
   * Camilla has beaten several levels, so some scale selections are accessible while some are grayed out. She picks the Ab Major scale, which will unlock the next level if passed.
   
   * The title and notes of the scale are shown on screen for a few seconds, and then the scroller begins.
   
   * Camilla controls her character to move up and down, collecting the coins that correspond to notes of the Ab Major scale.
   
   * Camilla makes it through the whole level without losing any lives, and is congratulated.
   
   * The app returns back to the scale-select screen, and the button for B Major is now available.
