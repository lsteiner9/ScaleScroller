## User Story:

I'm a high-school student who knows most of my scales, but there are some that take me a long time to figure out. The challenge mode of this app helps me to make sure my knowledge of all scales is up to speed.

## Use Case:

**Title:** Homework break

**Description:** Fitting in some scale practice as a break from math homework.

**Name of user & their role:**  Catey Rose, a high-school flautist. 

**Usage Preconditions:** Catey Rose has the app installed on her phone and has logged in.

**Usage post conditions:** Catey Rose has gotten some practice on random scales, and has had an enjoyable homework break.

**Interaction Flow:**

   * Catey Rose opens the app, and selects challenge mode.
   
   * The first random level is Gb major, and the name and notes of the scale appear on-screen for a few seconds.
   
   * The level starts, and Catey Rose only loses one life before beating the level. 
   
   * The next random level is A harmonic minor, and again the scale information appears on-screen before the level starts. 
   
   * With the slightly faster speed of this level, Catey Rose accidentally collects an F# coin and loses a life. The level ends, and the next random scale appears.
   
   * By the eighth scale level, the speed has gotten too fast, and Catey Rose has lost all three lives.
   
   * The screen shows her total score, which wasn't enough to get her on her top-10 high-score ranking this time.
   
   * Catey Rose closes the app and goes back to math homework.
