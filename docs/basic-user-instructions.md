## Basic user instructions

### Intended functionality

1. In the initial screen, sign in with Google or continue as a guest user. 

2. The title screen allows you to select Learn mode or Challenge mode, as well as having settings and logout options. Select the mode you wish to try. If you select Learn mode, you will have to select a scale - at first, only C Major is available. 

3. Pay attention to the notes that pop up on the resulting dialog - these are the correct notes in the scale, and collecting coins with other notes will make you lose a life.

4. Use the up and down buttons to control your character to move up and down. Collect the coins with correct notes to increase your score; avoid coins with incorrect notes, which each will make you lose a life.

5. You lose the level if you run out of lives. You win the level if you get to a certain score from collecting correct coins. If you selected Learn mode, you will return to the title screen and can play the same scale again or play a different scale unlocked by beating the level. If you selected Challenge mode, the levels continue until you run out of lives, and you then return to the title screen.

6. Is Learn mode too hard/too easy? Change the speed of the sidescroller in settings. If Challenge mode is too hard, work through more of Learn mode first. If it's too easy, congratulations, you are a ScaleScroller expert!
